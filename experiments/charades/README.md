### R-C3D code on charades dataset

### Please change the path in the corresponding file, and follow the instrucitons for the activityNet demo to run the code.



### Training:

1. Download C3D classification pretrain model to ./pretrain/ .

   The C3D model weight pretrained on Sports1M and finetuned on charades dataset is provided in: [caffemodel](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1os4a1K4pgjhRh8oiL7gO_DhM0NnCURHN/view)



### Testing:

1. Download one sample R-C3D model to ./snapshot/ .

   One R-C3D model on charades dataset is provided in: [caffemodel](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MpQxmkSdnIBt578pnpbT67kPu6HUXlez/view)

   The provided R-C3D model has the similar results reported in the paper.
